            </div>             
            <p>My motivation is to contribute to a better society and positively transform the lives of others.</p>
            <p>I currently pursue this ambition as a Product Manager at Selectra, where we simplify comparison and subscription to utility contracts.</p>
            <p>Originally from the resilient mountaineering community of the French Alps, I pursued my education abroad at world-class institutions. This experience exposed me to diverse ideas, people, and cultures, and helped me broaden my perspective of the world.</p>
            <p>My next steps are to leverage my skills and experiences as a platform for good. I am determined to serve and empower people and make a lasting impact on society.</p>

                <p>I studied computer science at Imperial College. My favourite module was Human-Centred Design. I developed a web application for a charity by applying the skills I learnt from this module. Our group ranked 2nd out of 48 when presenting our project to designers from the Royal College of Art.</p>
                <p>I took a course from the Dyson School of Design Engineering during which I collaborated with 50 other students as one consultancy firm. Our task was to design a scalable Mars settlement that would grow from 1,000 to 10,000 occupants and presented it to a consortium of parties from the Space Industry.</p>
                <p>I started Spanish by taking evening classes during my time at Imperial College. By my third year, I had progressed fast enough to be allowed to spend my final year in Spain.</p>
                <p>I took part in the “Mums and Dads” scheme where I advised and organised social events for a group of first year students.</p>
                <p>I was a member of the Department of Computing Society as well as the Salsa and Bachata society.</p>

                <p>I was a House Culture Monitor and led the annual house art competition where we came second out of fourteen houses.

                <p>I would spend my weekdays at the school, where I shared a room with 3 local boys my age. I fully immersed myself in the day-to-day life of a student at YK Pao School, from the traditional meals to the afternoon activities. During my time there, I was part of the sprint team in the athletics club and attended training every day. </p>
                <p>I also witnessed the poverty of rural areas and learnt about the history of Shanghai as I was guided by my host family through narrow streets, where beautiful temples and colossal shopping malls contrasted with swarming slums.</p>

                <p>I am part of the Integration squad at Selectra and our mission is to enable engineering squads to achieve more. We do so by providing them with simple and standardized APIs we build ourselves, abstracting the complexity and unreliability of external APIs in the energy industry. I directly collaborate with technical clients and partners, such as Enedis or GRDF, to obtain access to APIs, improve them by raising bugs, and build a strong relationship to improve the integration between our systems.</p>
                <p>I am responsible for defining and measuring success for our APIs, which I then translate into KPIs that I track every day to assess our impact. I make sure everyone understands the vision, that the squad is in direct contact with stakeholders, and that there is a short feedback loop in terms of frequent delivery to our users.</p>
                <p>I continuously meet with our users to emphasize with them and to understand their motivations by asking "why". This helps me identify a theme and define a clear problem to be solved, which I translate into user stories with acceptance criteria, and hypotheses to be tested. When the problem requires a creative solution, I use "How might we" statements and the jobs-to-be-done framework and I invite the whole team to ideate together.</p>
                <p>I then build, refine, and prioritize our backlog to best achieve our goals and deliver value rapidly. The hardest part of my job is saying "no", deciding what not to build and assuming the consequences of that decision. I seek feedback from our users as early as possible with rapid testing of ideas. I work closely with software engineers and drive story mapping workshops.</p>

                <p>I contributed to the development of a new voice-based assistive technology for people with mobility impairments, which simplifies common flows across applications on Windows.</p>
                <p>I led a user study to validate our product hypotheses, where I requested participants to think out loud while performing tasks with a prototype in order to understand their thought process and behaviors. I collaborated with a user research expert to design, run, and analyze the results from the study. I kept stakeholders up to date and discussed crucial decisions with them. Using results from the study, I suggested improvements to the design and encouraged the team to rethink the product vision.</p>
                <p>I conducted a competitive analysis on speech recognition software designed for people with reduced mobility. I researched key product features and gathered information on each company, mapping the competitive landscape of speech recognition products on Windows. I identified potential opportunities for Microsoft and developed a new product strategy using the analysis to backup my recommendations.</p>
                <p>Alongside a QA test analyst, I triaged defects on Cortana weekly. I prioritized bugs, directed them to the right development teams, and replied to partners when necessary.</p>
                <p>I also coordinated ongoing experimentations of new features on Edge, ensuring feature teams had a hypothesis that could be validated with data and gave an update on each experiment during the Edge weekly meeting. I collaborated with PMs and Engineers to ensure no team was blocked and that experiments ran smoothly.</p>

                <p>I composed a range of technical specification documents outlining the requirements for a minimal viable product and designed a prototype user interface for each stakeholder.</p>
                <p>Through this project, I was able to demonstrate near-real-time settlement of RECs, automated and decentralised issuance process, and trace back to the provenance of RECs thereby increasing transparency.</p>
