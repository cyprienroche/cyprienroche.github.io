            <p>My motivation is to contribute to a better society and positively transform the lives of others.</p>
            <p>I currently pursue this ambition as a Product Manager at Selectra, where we simplify comparison and subscription to utility contracts.</p>
            <p>Originally from the resilient mountaineering community of the French Alps, I pursued my education abroad at world-class institutions. This experience exposed me to diverse ideas, people, and cultures, and helped me broaden my perspective of the world.</p>
            <p>My next steps are to leverage my skills and experiences as a platform for good. I am determined to serve and empower people and make a lasting impact on society.</p>

                <br>
                <p>I collaborated with the sales department and energy providers, such as Octopus and La Bellenergie, to establish robust APIs enabling the seamless transfer of sales in just a few clicks. Every month, this integration received 30,000 requests and enabled 10,000 successful sales transactions.</p>
                <p>The addition of webhooks to automatize the sales status updates enhanced operational efficiency and saved the quality department 300 hours of work each month.</p>

                <p>I participated in the research efforts aimed at revitalizing Cortana, the voice-based assistant on Windows, and transforming it into a beloved product that resonates with users. The focus of the research was to explore innovative approaches and uncover new strategies for the Cortana product to reignite user engagement. </p>
                <p>I led a comprehensive user study to gain insights into user’s thoughts, behaviours, and preferences while interacting with a prototype of an enhanced version of Cortana. Leveraging the findings, I proposed key actions to improve the product.</p>
                <p>As the team shifted target user to people with mobility impairments, I conducted a thorough competitive analysis on speech recognition software for people with reduced mobility. Leveraging the findings, I recommended a new product strategy for Cortana to be successful in that market.</p>

                <p>In particular, I understood how to use the Tool Coordinate System to specify a tool’s centre point and orientation when the robot was holding a work object. That way, when that tool was active, the programmed path and speed were related to the object.</p>
                <p>I worked with a team of experienced technicians from the automotive industry and learnt about real-life use cases from our discussions. By the end of the training, I received an IRC5 certification.</p>

                    <p>I studied computer science at Imperial College. My favourite module was human-centred design, where my team and I built a web application for a charity using skills learnt during lectures.</p>
                    <p>I also took a course from the school of design engineering where I collaborated with 50 students as one group. We were evaluated by key players from the space industry on the design of a scalable Mars settlement that would grow to 10,000 occupants.</p>
                    <p>Driven by a desire to expand my horizons, I enrolled in Spanish classes. My rapid progress allowed me to spend my final year in Spain, fully immersed in the language and culture. </p>
